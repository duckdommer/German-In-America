      <p>Germans are masters of blending in in America. Even though we are the largest ancestry group in the US with over 45 million Germans (almost 15% of the whole population) one couldn't tell just by looking at local grocery stores. While other cultures are well represented, German products are hard to find. While you can find the occasional Haribo and Werther' Echte product, others are hard to come by, if you don't know where to look. This blog will help you find German products. I will take you to stores that cater to us. I will also review German movies and books you can get in America (Thank God for the internet, otherwise we'd be stuck watching "Das Boot" and listening to Rammstein). Here you will find everything German. Feel free to participate in the comments. Have fun with my blog!</p>
