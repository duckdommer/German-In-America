      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="images/dus1.jpg" class="pic">Germans are masters of blending in in America. Even though we are the largest ancestry group in the US with over
        45 million Germans (almost 15% of the whole population) one couldn't tell. While other cultures have strong footprints
        in many American cities, true German districts are rare. While other cultures are well represented, German products
        are hard to find. This is a website that will make your German life in America much better. While you can find the
        occasional Haribo and Werther' Echte product, others are hard to come by, if you don't know where to look. This blog
        will help you find German products. I will take you to stores that cater to us. I will also review German movies
        and books you can get in America (Thank God for the internet, otherwise we'd be stuck watching "Das Boot" and listening
        to Rammstein). Here you will find tips on everything German in America. Feel free to participate in the comments
        and have fun.</p>
